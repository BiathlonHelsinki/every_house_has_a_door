# every_house_has_a_door

Primitive (for now) Node app to query Biathlon API for authorised keyholders to unlock door via NFC IDs.

Repository name stolen from the Everyh house has a door performing arts group (Chicago, IL), because 'door' is a boring name for a GitHub repository. Thanks (or rather, 'sorry') to Matthew & Lin.
